ApeScript
=========

Add custom javascript to sites that you feel could use some custom things on it

-usage:
Install, and click on the script-looking icon by the address bar. Enter the script you would like to run when you go to that site.
To remove script, just delete all the javascript and click the update button, or you can do it in the settings page. Thats it.
