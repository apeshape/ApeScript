ApeScript
=========

Add custom javascript to all your favorite sites.

###usage:
Install, and click on the script-looking icon by the address bar. Enter the script you would like to have run when you browse that site.
To remove script, just delete all the javascript and click the update button, or you can do it in the settings page. Thats it.

The syntax highlighting bit is [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net). Awesome stuff.

####Disclaimer:
This extension is probably highly unsafe, and should also probably not be installed in your browser
unless you know exactly what you are doing, or why. It was made out of pure curiosity, and for fun,
and should be used with that in mind.
